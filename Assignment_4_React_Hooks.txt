Create a React application that allows users to search for a specific country and display information about that country, such as its flag, population, and capital. The application should make use of the useState and useEffect hooks, as well as a custom hook to handle the API calls. 
1.	Use the useState hook to create a state variable for the search term and another for the country information. 
2.	Use the useEffect hook to fetch data from the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/) when the search term changes. 
3.	Create a custom hook that handles the API call and returns the data. 
4.	Display the flag, population, and capital of the country when the user submits the search form. 
5.	Handle the case when no country is found for the given search term. 
6.	Add a loading state while the data is being fetched.
